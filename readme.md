This is a Shiny web-app that allows you to batch download citations and PDFs for the articles in the American Economic Review.

Just paste the URL of an issue you want into the Issue URL field, select the existing download folder on your computer, choose the desired citation format, and click Download!

To download PDFs, you have to have access to them via your organization and be on your organization's network. Access using your personal subscription and credentials will, probably, not work.

I might add new features in the future, let me know if you have any comments!
